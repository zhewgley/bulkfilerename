# Introduction

This script allows the user to provide a path to a folder in which they want to rename all of the files within.

## Steps

When prompted to 'Enter the path of a folder: ', provide an absolute path. Be sure to add a '/' or '\' at the end to access the files within the folder.

You will then be asked to provide a filename that will be the standard name for all files within the specified folder. Each file will have a incremented number placed at the end.

When prompted to 'Enter the extenstion: ', be sure to include the '.' before the extenstion abbreviation (.jpg , .py , .html)

After providing the required information, all files within the given folder will be renamed accordingly and saved.

If anyone is reading this, just know this is only my second project. I understand that it could probably written better and provide better functionality, but I am learning. If you would like to provide any feedback, that would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you!
